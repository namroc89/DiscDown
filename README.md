## Project Overview
DiscDown was created as my capstone 1 project for the Springboard software engineering course. The overall intent of the the site, is to create a way for people in a community to interact with each other around disc golf. 

While using DiscDown a user will be able to:

 *   Create an account
 *   Search for courses by name or zip
 *   View course information and hole details
 *   Search for users by username
 *   Add a new round 
 *   Follow/be Followed by other users
 *   Update own profile avatar
 *   Set a favorite course
 *   Remove existing rounds 
 *   View other users recent rounds

## API
I used the [Disc Golf Review Api.](https://www.dgcoursereview.com/api.php)  
This was an very easy to use API with information that was returned on a way that was very easy to implement.

## Future Plans 

I have several other features that I would eventually like this application to have:

* I would like this application to much more responsive to being used on a mobile device.
* Implement "Group Rounds" so that an individual users round can be saved along with everyone else who played together.
* Create a way for a user to save a "bag" of favorite discs.
* Implement an event calendar that can be used to schedule group rounds.
* Add more single page functionility
